    <p>Made with HTML, CSS and Javascript</p>

        “Things That Help Me Sleep a Little Better: Library of Gratitude” is an interactive website created for my CTC class using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The phrase “things that help me fall asleep a little better” stems from the idea that happiness is when there isn’t anything left to think about before going to sleep. Inspired by this thought, I built a digital library of gratitude—a collection of 100 images drawn from moments in my life. Each image turns to reveal a personal narrative, written in both of my mother tongues, capturing the memories, emotions, and gratitude tied to them. This project is more than a website; it’s an evolving archive of my experiences. In the future, hoping to expand it further, preserving even more of the memories that shape me.
